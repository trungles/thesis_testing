How it works:

python3 run_tests.py -> will fill a 'data' folder with timing data
python3 data_analysis.py -> runs tests on all on all .json files in timing data, writes the results out to a file named 'analyzed.json' (MUST BE EMPTY AND EXIST BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM)
python3 write_csv.py -> writes 'analyzed.json' out to 'res.csv' (MUST BE EMPTY AND EXIST BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM)
